# Cursor Rules

## Core Technologies & Patterns

- TypeScript with React 18 functional components
- Chakra UI v2 component library with custom theme
- React Router v5 for routing
- React Query (TanStack Query v4) for API state management
- Axios for HTTP requests

## Code Style & Formatting

- Follow existing Prettier config (100 char width, single quotes, semicolons)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props. Please avoid using `any`
- Prefer functional components with explicit prop types
- Use `@/` path alias for absolute imports from `src/`
- Simplify array/collection null/empty checks: use `!array?.length` instead of `!array || array.length === 0`
- NEVER add inline comments that explain what code does. Instead, use more explicit and descriptive variable, function, and component names that make the code self-documenting.

## Component Patterns

- Extend Chakra UI components with custom props when needed
- Use Chakra's responsive syntax (`base`, `md`, `lg` breakpoints)
- Export components as default exports

## API/Data Fetching

- Use React Query hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`) from existing patterns in `src/api/`
- Use Axios for custom HTTP requests when AbloAPI methods are not available
- Follow axios wrapper patterns established in API files
- Use `useQueryClient` for cache invalidation

## State Management

- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Use React Query for server state
- Use Context API for shared UI state when needed

## Import Organization

- Group imports in this order:
  1. External libraries (React, Chakra UI, React Router, etc.)
  2. Third-party packages (@tanstack/react-query, axios, etc.)
  3. Internal absolute imports with `@/` alias (components, utils, api, etc.)
  4. Internal relative imports (`./` and `../`)
  5. Type-only imports (when importing types/interfaces only)
- Separate groups with blank lines
- Within each group, alphabetically sort imports
- Use absolute imports (`@/`) for cross-directory imports instead of relative paths

## Styling Conventions

- Prefer Chakra's responsive prop syntax over custom CSS
- Use theme tokens from `src/theme/` (colors, breakpoints, etc.)
- Avoid inline style objects when Chakra props can be used

## File Structure

- Components go in `src/components/`
- API hooks in `src/api/`
- Utilities in `src/utils/`

## TypeScript

- Use explicit interfaces for component props
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use proper typing from Chakra UI and React
